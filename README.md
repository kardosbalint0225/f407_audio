# Audio driver for the STM32F4DISCOVERY board

## Layers

### Audio IO (low-level layer)
audio_io.h header file contains #define-s for the I2C, I2S, DMA and GPIO peripheral configuration.
Audio IO layer provides basic IO operations for the higher layers: read/write operations for the control port of the CS43L22
and stream write for the audio data.
